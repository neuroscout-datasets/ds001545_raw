Participants watched three different clips from the movie "The Grand Budapest Hotel", six times each. 

One clip was "intact" (viewed in its original order); one clip was scrambled but viewed in the same scrambled order for all six repetitions ("scrambled-fixed"). The last clip was also scrambled, but viewed in a different scrambled order for each of the six repetitions ("scrambled-random").

**TIMING**
The onset times in each '_events.tsv' reflects the onset times (in seconds) after discarding 3 volumes in a preprocessing step (for T1 equilibration). For these timing files to be relevant, first discard 3 volumes at the beginning of each functional run.

The "waiting for scanner" period at the beginning of the run-specific mp4 files takes longer than 4.5s (3 volumes at 1.5s TR) because the first multiband volume takes a long time to collect. Therefore, although the countdown to the first movie clip does not start until 37 seconds into each run-specific mp4, only 3 volumes were collected during that time. The first clip in each run onsets right after the countdown, which takes 6 seconds.

For convenience, below is a list of which volumes correspond to which movie clip in each run, after discarding the first 3 volumes of each run:
Clip 1: volumes 5 to 64 
Clip 2: volumes 71 to 130 
Clip 3: volumes 137 to 196 
Clip 4: volumes 203 to 262 
Clip 5: volumes 269 to 328 
Clip 6: volumes 335 to 394 

Timing is the same for all subjects and runs, though the assignment of specific movie clips to each of these 6 positions varies between runs and between counterbalancing conditions 1 and 2.

**COUNTERBALANCING CONDITIONS**
Subjects 1-15 are in counterbalancing condition #1 (stimuli labeled cond1); they viewed identical stimuli in the same order

Subjects 16-30 are in counterbalancing condition #2 (stimuli labeled cond2); they viewed identical stimuli in the same order. 

Subjects in counterbalancing conditions 1 & 2 watched the same 'intact' clip. The 'scrambled-fixed' clip for subjects in counterbalancing condition 1 was the 'scrambled-random' clip for subjects in counterbalancing condition 2, and vice versa.
